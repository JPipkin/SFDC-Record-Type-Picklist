## Code Samples

### Visual Flows

To add to visual flow, add "RTPL_FlowRecordTypeSelectList" to a screen element. This flow component supports up to 4 dependent picklists. There are 5 attributes you can set for each field:
- Name: The field API name
- Label: The field label
- Value: The selected value of the field
- Size: The width size of the picklist field (divided into 12). ie: "6" would be 50% width, "12" would be 100% width
- Required: Determines if the field is required

There are 3 more properties that apply to the whole component:
- addSelectOpt: Determines if the default picklist option is "--Select--" (true) or the first picklist value (false)
- sobject: SObject API Name that holds the field
- recordTypeName: Record Type label. Required if recordTypeId is not supplied
- recordTypeId: Record Type Id. Required if recordTypeName is not supplied

### Lightning Components

To add to a lightning component, use "c:RTPL_RecordTypeSelectList". This component inherits all of the properties of lightning:select. Here are the additional attributes:
- addSelectOpt: Determines if the default picklist option is "--Select--" (true) or the first picklist value (false)
- sobject: SObject API Name that holds the field. Required if sobjectField is not supplied
- recordTypeName: Record Type label. Required if recordTypeId is not supplied
- recordTypeId: Record Type Id. Required if recordTypeName is not supplied
- sobjectField: Fully qualified API name. If provided, sobject and fieldName are not used
- fieldName: The field API name

There is 1 method, getSelected(), that will return the value of the field if the "value" attribute is not set. Usage:
<pre>var selectedValue = component.find('mypicklist').getSelected();</pre>

#### Build Your Own UI

If you want to display the picklist values based on record type and dependencies in a different way, use the component "RTPL_RecordTypePicklistValues." This component will retrieve the 
picklist properties and return the information. Here are the attributes:
- sobject: SObject API Name that holds the field. Required if sobjectField is not supplied
- recordTypeId: Record Type Id. Required if recordTypeName is not supplied
- recordTypeName: Record Type label. Required if recordTypeId is not supplied
- recordTypeProperties: The picklist properties returned by the User Interface API. Returns instance of RTPL_PicklistValues wrapper.
- sobjectField: Fully qualified API name. If provided, sobject and fieldName are not used
- fieldName: The field API name
